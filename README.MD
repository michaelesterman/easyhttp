# EasyHTTP

This is a demo web server, based on a highly recommended Udemy course [Modern JS From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy).

It employs [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to get, post, update and delete JSON from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

Previous version is also available and uses [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## Deployment

This is a static asset. Clone the repo and adjust app.js.
